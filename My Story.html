    <<h1>YOLO, Nike! </h1>

             <p>“NOOOOOO! OMKAR, THIS IS NOT FAIR!!” argued my neighbor’s 5-year-old when my brother served him a slice of his birthday cake. His argument: he had gotten a smaller slice of cake compared to his friend. It was not my mother’s fault for not being able to slice the cake into equal parts. I knew there ought to be a better way to cut a cake. But did I want to waste half of my life trying to hone my cake slicing skills? Thinking that you only live once (YOLO), I Nike-ed. I designed a symmetrical cake slicer using an umbrella mechanism, leading up to a Provisional Patent Application with the USPTO. I enjoy solving problems using creative solutions to make life easier because I know I’m not the only one with the problem, and if we only live once, I want to make the most out of it.

  Reading famous cartoonist R.K. Laxman’s cartoons about the common man, I realized we are mortals born with the inevitable fate of death. But I believe death is just the finale of the play of life. What matters is the life leading up to this scene. We are not born to take a bow at the stage and leave, but rather to act out and live. This thinking led me to my firm beliefs in YOLO and Nike’s tagline. So you only live once? Just do it. But no, YOLO is not an excuse to account for my fear of missing out. For me, it is an opportunity to achieve something meaningful and live a life worth recounting.

                I breezed through my higher-level math course in my junior year, but little did I know calculus had dug a hole in the corner for me to fall into. I did not quit my higher-level math course even if I struggled to understand; I Nike-ed, because I believe failure and disappointment are guaranteed if I do not participate and ask the right questions. I continue to nurture this inquisitive mindset by asking questions out of sheer curiosity and using general intelligence to perceive things at an abstract level. Why? Why not? What if? What else? What’s missing? These curious questions are my best friends. With this growth mindset, I always ask myself, “How can I do it?” rather than “Why can’t I do it?”

  As they say, the best way to learn is to teach. This thought inspired me to become a math tutor for my juniors and a school hackathon mentor. For me, knowledge is similar to pollination. When a suitable pollen grain falls on the necessary stigma, a beautiful fruit develops. Similarly, if the proper knowledge is passed onto others the right way, they too can become successful and satisfied, the sole motive of YOLO. Reproducing my culminated plant of knowledge and seeing the delighted faces of my mentees, I receive sheer joy and gratifying emotions. I understood that I would only succeed by helping others succeed.

  I believe that whatever I have accomplished is due to the sacrifice of generations of women before me. They, too, went above and beyond YOLO to shape our society. I intend to take the same path. As an aspiring first-generation female STEM student, for me, computer science is far more than software programming. I do not plan to attend college simply for a degree but to participate, experience, and learn from the best minds to find affordable and ethical solutions for the needy. I am not sure how, as yet, but if YOLO, I want to Nike and make the world a bit more inclusive, Artificial Intelligence a bit less biased, and make a mark in this male-dominated field. This learning journey is the most precious part of my lifelong pursuit of personal satisfaction because I know: I only live once.
