    <h1>My Background, personal development and intellectual interests.</h1>
    <p>“Look over there!” yells my brother in excitement, pointing towards an elephant trying
  to cross the road ahead amongst the hectic traffic. I smile at his contagious enthusiasm and
  reply, “Been there seen that.” As a child, I too would often label such sightings as bizarre until
  I came to realize that it was a peaceful display of harmony between man and animal. Elephants
  crossing busy streets are surprisingly easy to spot in urban cities in India. I call this world
  “organized chaos.” I watched in awe as the elephant crossed the road elegantly, gesturing a
  thank you with its trunk. Having spent my formative years growing up in India and Singapore,
  I feel a part of this closely-knit yet diverse community of organized chaos.</p>

  I come from a world where people are obsessed with cracking puzzles. They have
  learned to survive on minimal resources and create innovative and affordable solutions for dayto-day problems. There is even a word for it, “Jugaad,” which roughly translates to fit for
  purpose, and is the art of problem-solving in India. Using a frying pan as a parabolic antenna
  to boost signal strength is Jugaad. Creating a washing machine from a bicycle that washes
  clothes by pedalling is Jugaad. I believe even the most complex issues can have simple
  solutions, and finding this sweet spot can be achieved by perceiving things at an abstract level
  using problem-solving skills. Growing up and seeing my family and neighbours ‘hack’ their
  way through daily problems gave me a firm grasp on creative problem-solving. I plan to bring this thought process of finding Jugaad solutions to solve
  challenges people face in developing countries.

  While my short-term goal is a degree in computer science, my long-term goal is to be
  a cybersecurity expert. Although cybersecurity requires advanced domain knowledge of
  systems and their workings, it is also an art to find a simple yet creative solution to complex
  security problems. The challenging nature of this art is fascinating to me. I believe, no matter
  how formidable our defences, no matter how thick our walls or how deep our moat, our weakest
  cybersecurity link will always be people. They are the most effective backdoor into a secure
  system, the leading cause of data leaks, and ultimately the biggest threat to an organization’s
  infrastructure.

  I firmly believe the cross-functional nature of computer science will bring more
  benefits to society than mere programming. Working on interdisciplinary projects such as
  Astrochemistry, Computational Biology, and Mathematical Statics under Nina Maksimova and
  Charles Law in Harvard’s Pre-college program strengthened my curiosity in
  multidisciplinary aspects of computer science. I believe, if we really
  want to keep our data safe, the best way is to understand how people think. I want to use my knowledge in many fields to bring
  the concept of Jugaad to rest of the world. I want to engage in inventing creative solutions to issues prevalent in computer
  science and more. I always look forward to meeting new people who can challenge me while working with me to build robust soulutions for tomorrow's world.
